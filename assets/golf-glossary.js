 "Ball retriever": "A device which is used to collect the ball from awkward places like areas of water. They are often telescopic and designed to fit in a golf bag.",
 "Ball marker": "Any object that is used to mark the position of a ball on the green.",
 "Belly putter": "A putter that is longer than a conventional putter, whereby the butt of the club rests on the torso of the golfer, which is used as a pivot point for the club to travel around.  They are typically over 40 inches long.  When they reach around 45 inches they become Long Putters.  This is a putter type that is surrounded by controversy due to claims that it makes putting too easy and violates the spirit of the game. See also Broom Handle Putter, Long Putter",
 "Buggy": "An electric car used to transport golfers and their equipment around the course.",
 "Back weighting": "Usually found in woods to promote a higher trajectory and stability, or in mallet putters to promote a better roll of the ball and a more stable club.",
 "Broomhandle": "See long putter",
 "Back Swing": "This is the part of the golf swing that starts at the address position and ends at the top of the swing. To a large extent the backswing determines how the club is swung on the through swing.",

 "Back nine": "The second nine holes on an 18 hole course, also known as the inward nine, or simply in.",
 "Breaking wrists": "When chipping or putting, many teachers advocate the use of stiff wrists, meaning that the hands should not remain at a constant angle to the forearms. The breaking of wrists is an unwanted trait that reduces consistency and is a common cause of topping the ball, chilli dipping and excessive power. Players revert to this way of playing when trying to gain extra height on chips and pitches, or for more power on putts.",
 "Butt": "This is the very end of the club on the side where the grip is located. Often there is a hole in the top of the butt.  This is often used as a reference point in golf instruction.",
 "Bump & Run": "When a shot is deliberately played along the ground or at a very low trajectory with several bounces before it reaches the target. This shot is used extensively on links courses which have notoriously hard greens and windy conditions which do not favour high lofted shots.

 "Cross Handed Grip": "Also known as left hand low, this is a grip of the club which sees the right handed placed higher up the grip than the left (in right handed golfers). This is the opposite of the conventional grips used in golf. Although not exclusively, it is predominantly used in putting by players who wish to eliminate the problem of wrist break or the yips.",
 "Compression": "The process which the ball undergoes when it is hit. The club head deforms the ball, and the rate of the deformation is termed compression or softness.",
 "Concede": "To acknowledge that you do not have a likely chance of winning the hole or match and allowing your opponent the privilege of not having to complete a putt, hole-out or finish the match. This is most commonly done when the opponent has a very short putt which he is not likely to miss, and is a sporting gesture rather than an admission of defeat.",
 "Chunk": "See Fat",
 "Chilli dip": "See fat",
 "Cut, 1st, 2nd": "The first cut is the area of grass adjacent to the fairway and is usually of a constant length (often the called light rough). The second cut lies beyond the first cut and is longer grass (often called the heavy rough).",

 "Core strength": "This relates to the power stored in the muscles of the abdominals and back.",
 "COR, Coefficient of Restitution": "This is the efficiency of energy transfer from one object to another. With regard to drivers, this is the efficiency of the clubhead in transferring energy to the ball. Although there are many other factors to consider, a higher COR will allow greater ball speed and greater distance in drivers. The Legal COR limit set by the R&A and USGA which came into effect in early 2008 is 0.83. The COR can range from 0 (where there is no transfer of energy) to 1 (where all energy is transferred). See also Trampoline Effect.",

 "Club Head Speed": "The velocity of the club head, usually measured as the top speed reached at impact with the ball.",
 "Cavity back": "Irons that have a hollowed out area at the back of the club. This is so that the weight taken out can be redistributed elsewhere. The redistribution of weight then creates a more forgiving club.",
 "Casting The Club": "When the wrists unhinge too early in the downswing resulting in a loss of clubhead speed.",

 "Centre of Gravity, CG or COG": "This is the location in space where the weight of the club head is centred. It may be located either on or off the club head and is often misinterpreted as the sweetspot. A low centre of gravity gives a club a higher trajectory shot than a club with a higher CG, provided the loft is the same.",
 "Cock Wrist": "A motion that is used in certain golf shots. If you hold your hands out in front of you with your palms touching, it is the movement in you wrists which brings your hands up and closer towards you.",

 "Driving iron": "Another name for the 1 or 2 iron, often one with a larger more forgiving head than usual.",
 "Dimple, Dimple Pattern": "Each golf ball has a series of indentations on the surface of the ball. These dimples allow the ball to travel more aerodynamically (and further) than if the ball was smooth. Dimple patterns are a way to maximise the aerodynamic properties of the golf ball.",

 "Draw": "A slight and controlled spin to the left (for a right handed player). This results in a slightly lower shot with less backspin and more roll than a fade or straight shot.",
 "Double-bend shaft": "This is a type of shaft used with some putters to allow for different amounts of offset and for visual purposes. For example some allow a clearer view of the golf ball at address giving a better view for alignment.",
 "Dogleg": "A hole that has a significant turn in the fairway (left or right).",
 "Etiquette": "This refers to the behaviour you are expected to show while you play golf as well as around the golf club. This can be hard to learn without first-hand experience as etiquette often follows unwritten guidelines rather than rules. Much of the guidelines are based in common sense and consideration for other players, such as not distracting other players, realising who has right of way, looking out for the safety of others and keeping a good pace of play.",
 "Effective loft": "The loft of the golf club at impact. By opening up the face of the club, the ball can be hit on a higher than normal trajectory, thereby it has a higher effective loft. The kick point of the shaft can also change the loft at impact.",
 "Elastomer": "A synthetic material that is sometimes used in clubs, golf balls, grips and putter face inserts.",
 "Even Par": "A score equal to the par of the course.",
 "Eagle": "A score of two under the par for the hole. Therefore it is a score of 3 on a par 5, or 2 on a par 4.",

 "Face Balanced": "A feature in some putters that allows the putter to be more stable. When balancing the putter shaft on your hand and allowing the shaft to rotate freely, the club face of a face balanced putter will face straight up. This is very useful for straight back  straight through putting strokes.",
 "Face angle": "Often used in golf instruction, this term describes the orientation of the club face in relation to the aim line. The face angle can be square, open or closed (shut).",
 "Flag, Flagstick": "This refers to the flag (and the shaft that holds the flag) that is found on the green of a golf hole. In some cases it is used to mean the hole in general.",
 "Flat swing": "A swing which travels on a plane that is more horizontal than normal. This is the opposite of an upright swing.",
 "Fluff": "See fat",
 "Flight Control Technology, FCT": "A proprietary term used by TaylorMade-adidas Golf. This system allows the removal of the shaft of the golf club on the R9 range of golf clubs. By doing this, the user can change the position of the shaft in relation to the club head. This allows for eight positions to choose from, including a neutral bias (lie angle is 1 degree flat), draw bias (face is 2 degrees closed), fade bias (face is 2 degrees open) and neutral upright (lie angle is 1 degree upright). The remaining four positions offer intermediate trajectories with the head angle 1 degree open or closed. Changing the shaft position in this way allows the user to change the shape of the golf shot from effectively a hook to a slice, to anything in between.",
 "Flier": "This happens when a ball is hit and travels much further than expected or wanted. This is because something has become trapped between the ball and clubface during impact (usually grass). A flier lie is a situation where you could reasonably expect a flier to occur based on the assumption that the contact with the ball will be compromised.",
 "Follow Through": "This describes the part of the golf swing after impact with the ball.",
 "Forged, Forging": "A manufacturing process whereby heated metal is pressed into shape rather than cast into moulds. This process is thought to create golf clubs with better feel than by casting.",

The result is a high shot that only travels 40 yards or less and lands very softly on the green, often staying where it lands with very little roll.",
 "Fairway Bunker": "A bunker that lies next to, or on the fairway. They are placed to make the course more difficult and are seen as hazards and penalise any misdirected tee shots",

 "Full swing": "Generally used to describe the most common swing in golf. It has a full backswing and through-swing and is used for most iron and wood shots. Other swings are used for flop shots, chips, pitches and putting.",
 "Fat": "Hitting the ball fat means that instead of hitting the ball first and then the ground, you hit the ground and then the ball. This slows down the club significantly and as a result the shot usually ends up well short of where you desired it.",
 "Flange": "The part of a golf club head that extends from the leading edge at the sole of the club to the back of the club.",
 "Fried Egg Lie, Plugged": "When a ball is hit into a bunker it sometimes creates a pattern on the surface of the bunker which resembles a fried egg. The ball stays where it lands and is only partly visible.",
 "Flat Lie": "A flat lie is one where the angle between the sole of the club and the shaft is less than normal. A club which is designed for a shorter player typically has a flatter lie angle while a taller player suits a more upright lie angle.",
 "Fade": "A slight and controlled spin to the right (for a right hand player). This gives a slightly higher, shorter and softer landing shot than a straight or draw shot.",

 "Glove": "A golf glove is used by most but not all golfers, and predominantly on the opposite hand to their strong hand. A right handed golfer will use a glove on the left hand and a left handed player on their right hand. Some players use gloves on both hands but this is very rare. The left hand is gloved (for the right handed player) because the majority of the grip pressure used to hold the club is applied by three fingers on the left hand, and so more grip is needed there.",
 "Golf Club": "Any of the various types of club used to strike the golf ball during a round of golf. Players are restricted to the use of a maximum of 14 clubs during competitions. A conventional set may include a driver, 3 wood, 5 wood, 3 iron to 9 iron, pitching wedge, sand wedge, lob wedge and a putter. Modern club sets now can also include hybrids, rescues, chippers and other specialist clubs.",
 "Graphite": "A composite material that is particularly strong for its weight. It is used for the shafts of nearly all drivers, most fairway woods and many irons.",
 "Gimme": "This is a putt that has an opponent has conceded to you in a matchplay situation. Usually very short putts are conceded as a sporting gesture and as recognition that the player would have holed the putt. There are no rules about gimmies as to what is an acceptable length to give or refuse, however sportsmanship and general politeness should be exercised. It is considered rude to request a Gimme, but it is also considered petty to refuse a putt that is so short the other player cannot miss. It is completely up to the discretion of the opponent however, and he is perfectly entitled to never give a Gimme.",
 "Gorse": "This shrub is found across the UK and parts of Europe. It is particularly spiny and difficult to play golf shots from.",
 "Green in Regulation, GIR": "To hit the ball onto the green within a specified number of shots. The GIR changes depending on the par of the hole. For a par 3 it is 1, for a par 4 it is 2 and for a par 5 it is 3. It is used as a statistic to show the accuracy of a golfer's approach shots.",
 "Gear effect": "This happens in clubs where the curvature of the club face is convex from heel to toe (known as bulge). As the club strikes the ball it is constantly rotating around its centre of gravity, with the toe of the club travelling faster than the heel. When a ball is hit on the toe of the club by a right handed player, the ball spins to the left because of the club's rotation about its centre of gravity. To counteract this spin the face is convex which starts the ball on a trajectory further to the right while the spin stays the same. Therefore the ball ends up straighter than it would have done with a straight-faced club. The same rules apply but in the opposite direction for an impact toward the heel of the club.",

 "Grass bunker": "Despite the name this is not considered a hazard, rather it is just area on the course that resembles a bunker due to its appearance and is grassy rather than filled with sand.",
 "Grain": "This is the direction that grass grows. It is mostly considered when trying to read putts on the green as it can have a significant effect on the roll of the ball and the distance travelled. The grain can vary from green to green and even within a green. Grain can have a much more noticeable effect on the ball with some grasses like Bermuda grass.",

 "Hole high": "To hit the ball the exact distance required, but not necessarily with the accuracy needed.",
 "High side": "See above the hole",
 "Hybrid": "Known by many different names such as rescue, utility, safety and trouble clubs, they are versatile and suited to play from many situations. They can be played from the rough, fairway and tee and are also used for chipping by some golfers. They are now replacing the long irons in many players' sets of clubs as they are more forgiving and give a higher ball flight.",

 "Hole": "Either the hole in the ground on the green that you aim to place the ball; or the name for each of the 18 playing areas that make up a (standard) golf course. The former is usually 4 ¼ inches in diameter and at least 4 inches deep. The latter is marked by boundaries to determine the playing area of that hole.",
 "Hickory, shaft": "These wooden shafts used to be the commonplace in golf clubs before steel shafts were introduced. Some putters, although very rarely, still use hickory shafts",

 "High modulus graphite": "A type of graphite that is very stiff.",
 "Handicap": "A scoring system that takes into account the ability of the golfer before they are awarded a score. It is used so that golfers of different abilities can compete together. The higher a handicap is, the worse the golfer is (generally speaking!). A golfer who plays off a handicap of 0 is called a scratch golfer. It is possible for very good golfers to have a plus handicap where they add their handicap to the score rather than taking it away.",
