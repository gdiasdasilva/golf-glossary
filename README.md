# 🏌️‍♂️ Golf glossary

Webpage that shows a different golf term on each refresh. Built for fun, to be my homepage, in order to get familiarized with the golf jargon.

It's published at [gdiasdasilva.github.io/golf-glossary](https://gdiasdasilva.github.io/golf-glossary). Feel free to use it. 🙂

Example:

> ## Tending the pin
> 
> This is holding the flagstick at another golfer's request. If a golfer cannot judge the distance of a putt and is on the green, he may have someone tend the pin / flag by the hole.

The golf terms were scrapped from [GolfOnline.co.uk](https://www.golfonline.co.uk/golf-glossary).
